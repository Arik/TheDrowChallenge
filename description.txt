The Drow Challenge is simple: the surface kills you very quickly. New worlds will set the spawnpoint underground and new characters will start with 1 torch.

This mod also adds a new potion type, sustainability, which allows you to go to the surface temporarily. This will allow you to fight skeletron, explore floating islands, and more without dying - but on a time limit.

In addition, this mod allows the Eye of Cthulhu and the Mechanical Bosses to spawn underground.
